	The goal of this gamemode is to elimate every player from the opposing teams.<br>
	If you are a civilian, escape to gain better loot and grant your team tickets - if you are an allied armed class, help them.<br>
	<br>
	There are 3 teams, and they each have a few classes.<br>
	-Nexpharma, with MERCS (blue, A3W3, can't start as) and Enforcers/Guards (cyan, A1W1) as armed classes, and with Staff (green, A1W0) as civilians.<br>
	-Terrorists, with JET (orange, A2W3, can't start as) as armed classes, and with Inmates (yellow, A0W0) as civilians.<br>
	-Monsters, with Mutated Mantis (red) and Mutated Crawler (pink). Can use regular doors and trams. For secure doors, break them. There are also the husks if the host is doing a husk round.<br>
	<br>
	Nexpharma and Terrorists spawn together at opposites sides of the surface on spawnwaves<br>
	<br>
	You will find and spawn with keycards. They can have up to 3 tiers (starting at 0) of 2 different perms, those being Admin (A) and Weapons (W).<br>
	Elite Guard (light blue, A2W2) and Overseer (purple, A3W0) are nonexistant classes, but you'll find their highly valuable keycards laying around.<br>
	<br>
	Admin 1 allows access to Shafts, Tram 512, Offices and Medbay.<br>
	Admin 2 allows access to Tram 256 and 128 (which lead to the exit).<br>
	Admin 3 allows access to R&D rooms with experimental technology.<br>
	Weaponry tiers allow access to armories (first A+Wallmounted, then B and finally C), the higher the tier, the better the loot.<br>
