        Opium is a chemical that is used in the production of other medicine. It's produced by Nexpharma and can be found inside their facilities.<br>
        It's good at healing damage and minor burns, but it will lower your oxygen levels. Taking too much will lead to addication and eventual overdose.<br>
        <br>
        If you have a sufficent enough medical skill of 16, during a duration of 5 seconds you will have these effects applied per second:
        <ul>
            <li>-3 for afflictions of the type <mono>damage</mono>.</li>
            <li>-1 for afflictions of the type <mono>burn</mono>.</li>
            <li>+3.75 for afflictions of the type <mono>oxygenlow</mono>.</li>
            <li>+1 for afflictions of the type <mono>opiateaddiction</mono>.</li>
            <li>+1.76 for afflictions of the type <mono>opiateoverdose</mono>.</li>
            <li>-3 for afflictions of the type <mono>opiatewithdrawl</mono>.</li>
        </ul>
		<br>
        If you have a insufficent amount of medical skill (lower than 16), the total amount of the afflictions will be given out over a period of 10 seconds.<br>
        Example: Given (t*2)(a/2), if (5)(3) or 5 seconds of -3 damage, then it will be (10)(1.5) or 10 seconds of -1.5 damage.<br>
